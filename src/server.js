The Phantom was subsequently updated in 2022, given subtle design and equipment tweaks, and we expect to test the updated version very soon.", imageUrl: "https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/rolls_royce_phantom_top_10.jpg?itok=P4JYsn-X", type: "Ultimate-Luxury" })

While its street-tough styling doesn't quite level with the refined elegance of some the cars elsewhere on this list, there can be no denying its claims as a luxury operator. Lavish and refined to travel in, with on-board technology options that even Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Tesla don't offer, the i7 is probably the greatest luxury EV of the moment.", imageUrl: "https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw_i7_top_10.jpg?itok=_U_FkyCu", type: "Sports" })

Crewe's luxury saloon also benefits dramatically from a new platform, which was co-developed with Porsche and uses four-wheel steering and active anti-roll bars. It also better insulates the fantastically opulent cabin from the road and provides the basis for genuinely good driving dynamics. Grip, balance and steering are all noticeably improved.", imageUrl: "https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bentley_flying_spur_top_10.jpg?itok=S46_2hDH", type: "Sports" })

The ultra-rare, Simon Cowell-spec, Maybach-only 57 and 62 limousines were at the same time consigned to history.", imageUrl: "https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mercedes-maybach-s-class_top_10.jpg?itok=PZxoKqGW", type: "Comfort" })
        server.create("van", { id: "2", name: "Rolls-Royce Ghost", price: "30,000", description: "Now in its second generation, the Phantom's understudy has evolved substantially. Where the Ghost's mechanical underpinnings were once adapted from those of the BMW 7 Series, it now shares the same Architecture of Luxury platform as the Phantom and the Cullinan SUV. There are also innovations, such as Rolls-Royce's mass dampers for the front suspension and an active anti-roll bar for the rear axle, both of which help bring ride quality closer than ever to that of the Phantom.", imageUrl: "https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/rolls_royce_ghost_top_10.jpg?itok=E8K24ujB", type: "Ultimate-Luxury" })
